                &emsp;Designing an effective curriculum is very important, but the best curriculum in the world will not help my students learn if I am not capable of implementing it. I can create an assignment that allows space for autonomy, mastery, and purpose (Pink, 2009, p. 218-219), but if that is not clear to my students or if they think that they are not capable of completing the project, for whatever reason, then all of that careful planning goes to waste. One of the most important concepts when it comes to implementing an effective lesson is growth mindset. Dweck pioneered the idea that if a student believes that they can grow their intellect, if they have a growth mindset, then they will put in the required effort, focus on their learning, and show resilience. Students who have a fixed mindset, however, who believe that a person is either smart or dumb and that there is no changing that. These students have tremendous difficulty with setbacks and failures because they believe that it shows them that they are simply not good enough and think that having to put in effort means that they are not smart (2010, p. 26-27).
                </p>
                <p>
                &emsp;This is a particularly important concept in my robotics classroom because the assignments are very challenging and failure happens every day, no matter how “smart” you are. The best students in the class are the ones who clearly show a growth mindset and learn from each and every setback. There are many ways that I try to help my students attain a growth mindset in my classroom because it is such an important concept. While I do not specifically use the words “growth mindset,” we talk about how failure is a skill. In my class, we talk about how failure is something that you have to practice and get better at so that you learn and grow from it rather than becoming upset and quitting.

                &emsp;I also take care to look for growth and praise it when it happens, especially when a student feels that their growth is insignificant or is comparing their growth to another peer’s abilities and feels that they are still not “good enough.” It is important to help my students remember that everyone starts at a different place when they walk into my classroom but no one is better than anyone else and everyone has different skills that they bring to the table. We also have discussed how “natural talent” is usually not very natural. For example, I have had students comment on how one particular student is “naturally” a very good designer. In front of the class, we discussed how he just played with Legos a lot as a kid and basically just has more practice designing than many other students in the class. It is not something that he was born with, it is just something that he worked on before he came to my class.  I also truly believe that each and every one of my students is fully capable of growing and becoming better at everything. All of these practice, including my own mindset, are supported by research as ways to promote a growth mindset in students (Dweck, 2010, p. 28).

                &emsp;Responsive teaching is also at the center of my teaching practice. I work very hard to be flexible in the way that I teach so that I can respond to my students’ needs. Salas’s article, “The Best Discipline is a Good Curriculum” points out that when students are engaged in the course content, they are better behaved and less time needs to be spent explicitly working on classroom management (2004, p. 185-188). While I absolutely agree that the curriculum plan is important, responding to the needs of a class quickly and effectively has been just as essential. For example, the best made plans can fall apart when you realize that your entire class has much more or much less experience than you expected them to. The best way that I have found to effectively implement a lesson, then, is to be willing to change it if I need to. That way, even when there are bumps in the road and unexpected developments, I can adapt my lesson to suit my student needs, keep them engaged, and not spend all of my time focused on managing the classroom rather than actually helping my students acquire knowledge and understanding.

                &emsp;A responsive teaching classroom is, by necessity, a student-centered classroom. In order to be responsive to my students, I must have an understanding of my students’ knowledge, skill levels, and interests (Bransford, 2004, p. 24). The relationship between student and teacher is very important in a responsive teaching classroom because there are countless ways to teach the same content. A responsive teacher is able to pick out what methods of teaching are best for each student in her classroom and utilize them appropriately so that everyone is able to learn the course content (Tomlinson, 2006, p. 18). 
                </p>
                <p>
                &emsp;Reflecting upon my own teaching over the course of the past two years, I have begun to realize just how much of an emphasis I place on responsive teaching. If I see that my students are frustrated with a project, we stop to talk about why learning to deal with frustration is useful and what I can do to help keep the frustration down to manageable levels. If I notice that my students are bored in a lecture based class, I stop and give them a project instead. If they give me the feedback that they need more support in the project, I adjust and give them readings to go along with the project so that they have a place to start from. If they do not understand why I will not tell just tell them how to solve a problem, I make it a point to explain how learning to problem solve for yourself is an important skill. I am flexible about due dates, although I try not to be too lenient, and I am constantly seeking feedback from my students about how my class is going for them and what I can do to improve.

                <p>
                &emsp;Before writing this reflection, I really did not think about how important being responsive is to me and to my students. Now that I am more aware of the role that responsive teaching plays in my classroom I hope to make more mindful decisions about when and I how I employ responsive teaching strategies in order to make my classroom an even better place to learn.
