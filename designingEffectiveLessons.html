                &emsp;A strong understanding of how people learn is incredibly important when it comes to being a great teacher and designing effective lessons. However, at the beginning of PRMT, I really did not have a good understanding of how learning and memory worked. This is one area where my eyes were really opened to the wealth of research and information about the science of learning and education. Brown’s article “Make it Stick” was one of the first things that I read for PRMT. I remember reading it and thinking, “Why has no one ever told me any of this before??” It was from Brown that I first learned about concepts such as interleaved and varied practice. From that same article, I also learned what goes into retrieval from memory, how important it is to create a mental model that is connected to prior knowledge, and just how bad people are at knowing when they are actually learning (2014, p. 3-6). Although nothing in the article was really that groundbreaking, reading it was like being told that the sky is blue and then looking up to finally notice that it is, even though it had been there the whole time. Reading that article was the first time that I had really sat down and thought about what actually goes into learning something.

                &emsp;My journey into learning how people learn continued throughout the Penn program. Engagement and motivation were two central concepts throughout the program. From Lawrence Smith, the Dean from St. Paul’s School, I learned that “The one who does the work does the learning” (2015). I heard that statement over and over throughout the program but I found that it really is true. Sometimes, when I find myself doing something like teaching a lecture and realize that it is not going the way that I want it to, I still come back to that quote. I have to remember that in order to take my students on the long journey from an experience to immediate memory to working memory to long term memory, and finally, to actual knowledge and understanding, they have to be the ones engaging with the information. The PRMT pedagogies, such as write to learn and think-pair-share are good jumping off points to begin taking a class from unengaging to engaging (Smith, 2015).

                &emsp;Nakkula &amp; Toshalis also consider the relationship between engagement and learning. They discuss the zone of proximal development (ZPD), the area where students are challenged, but not too challenged, and learn their best. If an exercise is too challenging, above the ZPD, students are frustrated and unmotivated. If an exercise is not challenging enough, below the ZPD, then students are bored and unmotivated (2013, p. 10-11). Finding a ZPD that works for all of my students, who have different levels of experience and interest, has been one of the most challenging thing about designing my courses. I often find myself creating lessons and projects that are too difficult because I have always considered myself a slow worker and so I assume that my students will work faster or at least at the same pace that I do. I have accidentally assigned projects that are much too difficult or take far too much time because of this but I am continuing to grow in my ability to better pinpoint the ZPD for my students.

                &emsp;The Deerfield fellows read the book Drive which focuses on the difference between how we try to motivate people at work and in schools and what science says actually motivates people. It suggests that in order for people to be motivated they should have autonomy, seek mastery, and have a sense of purpose (Pink, 2009, pg. 218-219). I do my best to create an environment where all three of the elements necessary for intrinsic motivation are readily available. The biggest factor in creating this environment has been the use of an experiential learning curriculum. When I ask my students to complete a project, I try to make it as relevant to “real life” as possible so that they have a sense of purpose. I also usually set them free to work and will go around and check on them, offering small pieces of advice but doing my best to allow them to maintain a healthy sense of autonomy where possible. I also make it a habit to ask my students what they have learned and what they have accomplished on any given day so that they can begin to develop a sense of their progress and trajectory towards mastery.

                &emsp;Understanding by Design (UbD) is a framework that ties together many of the most important concepts that I learned while in PRMT. When we first started learning about UbD, I had a moment where I suddenly realized that UbD was the way I had prepared for the courses that I taught at a summer program that I work for called Explo. When I had done UbD at Explo, however, I had not known that the process even had a name. It was exciting to learn more of the “why” behind UbD as well as the lower level details of how UbD is supposed to work. While it might be easier to decide the activity first and then choose the assessments and takeaways based on the activity, UbD starts with the takeaways. Once a UbD instructor decides what she wants her students to know, then she begins to consider how she will know when her students know those things, and finally she considers how to get them to that knowledge. This is called backward design because it is a process that plans backward from the desired results (Tomlinson, 2006, p. 27-28).

                &emsp;Although creating a curriculum plan based on desired results might seem like the most obvious way to plan a class, it is surprisingly easy to accidentally avoid doing so. A common mistake is to think of an activity or a project that sounds good and to create goals around that activity. This method is definitely capable of creating a good lesson but it is much less intentional than UbD. The activity leads to the goals rather than the other way around. This may result in an important concept or goal being glossed over or ignored entirely. Similarly, it is easy to focus on the assessment tool, such as an AP exam, rather than on the concepts that students should be learning and why they should be learning them. UbD is a way of slowing down and making sure that every assessment lines up with an activity and that every activity lines up with a goal. It promotes continuity between all of the moving parts of a good curriculum.

                &emsp;It takes a significant amount of time to create UbD curriculum but is probably the most intentional method of class design that I have come across. I have found that there is no way to properly complete a UbD curriculum design without becoming rock solid in what you are teaching and why. Even when I do not do UbD, I find myself considering the questions that I have to ask myself when I am doing UbD. I think about what I want the main takeaways to be for my students, how I plan to find evidence that they have understood those takeaways, and what structures I plan to use to get them to those takeaways. An example of a <a href="#ubdImages">UbD unit</a> that I created in my second year of PRMT can be found below.

                &emsp;All of the things that I have discussed so far, and many others, have influenced my teaching greatly even if I do not explicitly think about them every single day. Simply being aware of how people learn, how to engage them, and methods for planning out an effective curriculum have had an amazing impact on how I go about teaching my students every day. In the future, I would like to be more sharply aware of the influence that all of these concepts have in my classroom on a daily basis. Rather than having them in the back of my head, I want them to be in the forefront of my mind while I teach and design my curriculum.
