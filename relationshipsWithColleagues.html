                &emsp;A boarding school is definitely a unique work environment. Instead of coming into work at 8 am and leaving at 5 pm, employees often eat, teach, workout, and hangout with their colleagues since most people live no more than a block away from anyone else. When you live so close to your colleagues, going to the “outside” world seems like a much further trek. In addition, weekends are not sacred as a member of the boarding school community. Many terms, I have not had a single day off in a given week. With a work schedule like that, it makes sense that my relationship with my colleagues is a bit different than it has been in some other work environments.
                </p>
                <p>
                &emsp;In The Intentional Teacher Gow comments on how small disagreements can be magnified by the intensity of a school environment (2009, p. 2930). I think that this is absolutely a true statement and that it is especially true in boarding schools. In my own experience, I have found that it can be difficult at times to navigate the multiple relationships that I have with one colleague. For example, I live in a house with several other PRMT fellows. The people that I live with are my housemates, my friends, my work colleagues, and my fellow students. Keeping in mind that many relationships at once and considering how my actions will affect each of those relationships when asking someone to clean up a mess around the house can be very challenging. Although maintaining some boundaries with colleagues is essential, it can be difficult in such a isolated and constantly demanding environment like a boarding school.

                &emsp;In such a close environment, it is natural that some romantic relationships would emerge. In fact, at boarding schools it is extremely common for both partners in a marriage to work at the school. Although I have avoided romantic entanglement at school myself, the practice has still had an impact on how I relate to my colleagues. One thing that I love about this environment is that I get to know my colleagues’ families and become friends with them as well. There are certain families that I often eat dinner with and it is wonderful way to get to know my colleagues’ kids and significant others in a really low pressure environment. It is also worth noting that sometimes those relationships with a colleague’s significant other are some of the most relaxed that I have because I do not have to navigate multiple relationships with them, they are just a friend.

                <p>
                &emsp;However, Gow notes that failing romantic relationships can be very difficult for a tight-knit school community to handle, going so far as to say that only a student death is more traumatic than a relationship within the school that tears a family apart (2009, p. 2958). Obviously, knowing both sides of a partnership in this situation can be very challenging. Gow advises against taking sides or even offering advice because of how difficult situations like this can become but admits that actually keeping to that advice can be nearly impossible (2009, p. 2958). My only experience with this situation has thankfully been as positive as it can be. Both partners in the relationship are very civil to each other and actually both still work for the school. I still talk with both of them and there does not seem to be any issue with that. I can imagine, however, situations that are much more complicated than the one that I find myself in with that particular relationship.

                <p>
                &emsp;Another relationship that is important to consider is the relationship between faculty and staff. The staff does so much to keep the school running on a daily basis and their work allows me to teach. Their work is not something that I should take for granted and I do my best to always make sure that I thank people and am polite to them when I see them (Gow, 2009, p. 2958). Although I am notoriously bad at names, I also really try to both ask and remember staff names which sounds like such a basic courtesy that it is almost insulting. However, at my school there is quite the divide between faculty and staff which has been a topic of serious discussion in our office of inclusion. I want to be sure that I am not adding to that divide.

                &emsp;One relationship with a colleague that has been amazing for me, however, is my relationship with my mentor. Porter suggests that mentoring can support new teachers both psychologically and professionally (2005, p. 70). My mentor has done an amazing job of helping me and being present when I need it. The most important thing that he has done is simply being available to talk when I need it. Sometimes, when I have had a particularly difficult class, I will ask him if he has a second just to talk about what happened and how I can go about handling it during the next class. Even though our set meeting time is before rather than after class, he pretty much always makes time to talk with me and he always has good advice. A significant amount of the growth that I have obtained in the past two years comes from conversations with my mentor. I value my relationship with my mentor very highly and truly do not think that I could have gotten this far without him. I would definitely like to continue to maintain my relationship with him after I leave the Penn program and I would like to try to develop a similar type of relationship with someone at my new school so that I can continue to grow.
                </p>
                <p>
                &emsp;I feel like most of the guidance that PRMT gave me on relationships was focused on my relationships with students rather than with other teachers. Although it would have been helpful to have more explicit guidance on how to relate to colleagues, that does not mean that the information provided is not applicable to relationships with adults as well, however. Cultural competency, learning to say a person’s name correctly even when the name is unfamiliar or being aware of how different cultures dress and interact with one another, is just as applicable to colleagues as it is to students. Boundaries are also just as important between colleagues as they are between faculty and students, the lines are just drawn in different places. It is incredibly important to maintain healthy relationships with the people that you work with and I hope that I continue to grow and learn in this area throughout my career.
