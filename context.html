                &emsp;A boarding school is its own little world. In fact, boarding schools fit the criteria for Goffman’s “total institutions” quite well. Faculty and students at boarding schools do everything within the confines of the school campus, are always in each other’s company, are very tightly scheduled, and there is a single goal that everyone in the community is trying to reach together - the education of students . The fact that boarding schools fit the criteria for total institutions is interesting because the other institutions that fit the categories are prisons, mental institutions, and monasteries (1961). Within the total institution of a boarding school, there is a unique culture that is separate from the world around it. Students and faculty often refer to this as “the bubble.” They are aware that they live in an environment that is different from everything around it. This is visible in every aspect of life from the way community members dress to their political view.

                &emsp;Due to my lack of knowledge and experience in the boarding school world, my transition to working at one was probably more difficult than most.  Before my first day of work at at my school I had literally never set foot on a boarding school campus. I interviewed for my position from abroad over video chats and I went to a large public high school for my own education. The environment inside of the total institution that is the school that I work at is so different from any other environment that I have lived in that it was difficult to learn how to navigate it, especially since everyone seemed to assume that everyone already knew all of the customs.

                &emsp;Many of the schools that participate in this program have been in existence for hundreds of years. Although these boarding schools have a lot in common, each one has their own unique traditions and practices. The longer their histories, the more deeply ingrained the traditions are. The PRMT program provided literature from many different perspectives and many different schools in order to provide the cohort with an overview of what boarding school culture is like. This was important for me because I had no sense of the history before beginning the program.

                &emsp;From The Headmaster, I learned how one head of school completely revolutionized Deerfield Academy by essentially setting himself up as a benign dictator (McPhee, 1967). From Black Ice, I learned what it was like to be one of the first students of color at Saint Paul’s School (Cary, 1991). The Headmaster’s Papers provided me with a glimpse of what it might be like to be in a position of power at a school that must change to keep up with the world around it (Hawley, 1983). Old School helped me understand the differences and similarities between co-educational and single gender boarding schools (Wolff, 2004). I definitely learned a lot from my own experiences but it was helpful to also gain some small understanding of what the broader historical context of boarding schools is.

                &emsp;In terms of my own experience, however, I often found myself feeling at odds with boarding school tradition. Although my school has a strict dress code, I tell my students that they are welcome to take off their coats in my class because it makes it both easier and safer to work in a robotics classroom. In my first year of teaching, I had to fight to get a locker in the faculty women’s locker room rather than a student locker room because that locker room is very small since the school used to be for only for boys. That experience was significant to me because if I had to fight as a faculty member to be treated as an equal despite being female, I should consider how my female students have to fight against “tradition” in order to be treated as equals.

                &emsp;Traditionally, people who look like me and have the background that I do are not the people who end up at boarding schools. If the world had really kept strongly to tradition, I would not be here at all since I am mixed race. There are some traditions at my school that I really enjoy, ones that feel like they really bring the school together. However, many times tradition stands in as a reason for resisting progress. As a teacher, I want all of my students to feel safe and valued, regardless of whether or not people like them have traditionally been represented in the space where I teach. It is important to understand the context of boarding schools, however, to make sure that I am responding to the right needs and understanding the system within which I am working and trying to promote progress.
