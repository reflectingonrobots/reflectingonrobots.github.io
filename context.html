                &emsp;This inquiry project is rooted strongly in my own educational experiences. I have attended large and small, public and private, and experiential and lecture-based institutions. This breadth of experience has allowed me to investigate what teaching and learning methods work best for my own learning. In this inquiry project I explore how the methods that I found most successful for myself are supported by research and how they can be used to further the learning of my students. In particular, I examine the relationship between reflection and experiential learning and how both of these teaching practices can be employed in a robotics classroom.</p>
                <p>
                &emsp;When I graduated from high school I had a wealth of knowledge in my head and absolutely no idea how to use it. My educational experience prior to college consisted of sitting in classrooms crammed wall to wall with tiny desks from which we hardly ever moved. I took as many AP classes as I could and I did well on every test but I would be hard pressed to say that I really remember very much at all of what I learned in high school.</p>
                <p>
                &emsp;My college experience, however, was very different. The college that I attended prides itself on being a teaching college, where professors can focus on teaching students rather than just generating research. If there was a large lecture class, there was a small recitation section or hands-on lab that accompanied it. As I moved through the curriculum both autonomy and the number of hands-on experiences increased even more. The classes that I learned the most from where often the most difficult and the most hands-on experiences. I found that these hands-on experiences taught me much more than the lecture courses, in terms of both content and skills.</p>
                <p>
                &emsp;Without a doubt, I am much more in touch with the learning that I did in college than the learning that I did in high school. While this a somewhat biased comparison because the learning that I did in high school was the basis of my learning in college, high school is further away in terms of time, and because I was able to focus my studies on my passions in college, I still feel that the experiences that I had in college allowed me to learn on a deeper level than I did in high school. 
                These educational experiences have led me to develop experiential, projects-based courses in my own teaching practice. It is my hope that by using these teaching methods, I will help my students begin to attain the deeper levels of learning that I found in college at an earlier stage in their educational careers. I have also found that experiential curriculum tends to allow for more creativity and autonomy, two other important skills that I would like to see my students develop.
                At the end of my first year of teaching, I was generally happy with the development that my students showed in my courses. I felt that my experiential classes had been successful in helping my students develop both content knowledge and skills. I planned to use my inquiry project as a space to further develop my skills in teaching in an experiential learning classroom and I began this process with an inquiry question that would help me do that. I asked the question, “How can experiential teaching practices be used to promote collaboration, problem-solving skills, and a sense of purpose in students?”</p>
                <p>
                &emsp;However, as I tried to answer that question, I still had the nagging feeling that something was missing from the equation. As I thought back to my own college experiences, I felt that I could have learned more. I thought about how everything was always moving so fast that I never had time to stop and think about what I was learning or why. I began to realize that my students probably shared this lack of time and space to think about their own learning in the busy schedules that we require that they keep. Suddenly, the reflective journals that I was asking my students to write as a method of data collection became the focus of my inquiry project. I began to wonder just how deep the connection between learning, particularly experiential learning, and reflection ran. This led me to develop a new question, “How can intentional reflection be used in conjunction with experiential learning to improve student learning outcomes?” This is the question that will be explored throughout the remainder of this paper.
