            <h2>Penn Master's Residency in Teaching Program</h2>
            <p style="text-align: left;">The Penn Master's Residency in Teaching (PRMT) Program is a specialized teacher education program for early career boarding school teachers. Cohort members are employed by one of the nine participating boarding schools and meet with their cohort four times a year in person. The rest of the coursework is done online. The program blends theory and practice in an innovative way in an attempt to prepare the next generation of outstanding teachers. The program will soon be expanding to include a day school cohort.</p>

            <h2>Website Design</h2>
            <p style="text-align: left;">I designed and coded this website from scratch for this inquiry project. Since I am a strong believer in experiential learning and I needed to brush up on my web design skills for a class that I am teaching, I thought that it could be a great learning opportunity to make this website from the ground up. I learned a lot and it was also a lot of fun! The code is available on GitHub. All photographs are my own, taken in the robotics classroom, with the exception of the images in the student work section.</p>
