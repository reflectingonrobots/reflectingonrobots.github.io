                &emsp;I have found a rather limited range of difference in my classroom, particularly when considering neurodiversity. Since I teach at an elite boarding school, all of my students have successfully proven themselves over and over again before they are even allowed to set foot on campus as a student. Then, since I teach electives, I tend to see almost all upperclassmen who are passionate about the subjects that I teach. This narrows the range of students that I see in my classroom significantly. However, I see a significant difference in experience level as well as differences in race/ethnicity and gender.

                &emsp;There are many ways of addressing achievement gaps in the classroom, regardless of their cause. Yeager discusses how psychological interventions can be used in conjunction with traditional teaching methods to improve learning outcomes. One important point that Yeager brings up is that even if every student experiences the same event or lesson, the way that they experience it will be unique for each student (Yeager, 2013, p. 62). As a teacher, it is necessary to think about how each of my students is experiencing my classroom and to try to consider how I can adapt my classroom to my students’ needs.

                <p>
                &emsp;For example, lecturing is a method of teaching that seems like the same experience for every student on the surface. Growing research suggests, however, that lectures are actually biased against minority groups such as women and first-generation college students. It is possible that this achievement gap is occurring because the minority groups affected come in with less background knowledge to connect the material in the lecture to, which hampers learning (Murphy-Paul, 2015, p. 2). This is an example of students sharing an experience (sitting in a lecture hall hearing someone speak) but experiencing it differently (one student might connect everything to a fully elaborated mental model while another furiously writes down terms to look up that she has never heard before). This is one reason that I do my best to minimize the use of lectures as a means of teaching in my classroom.

                &emsp;One psychological method suggested by Yeager is the cultivation of a growth mindset in students (Yeager, 2013, p. 62). Making an effort to help my students develop and maintain growth mindsets is one of the most significant ways that I try to address difference in my classroom. Research shows that stereotyping can negatively impact student performance but that a growth mindset can help counteract that. This is because a stereotype is a fixed mindset belief. Someone who believes a stereotype is essentially saying that because they identify as one thing then they must also be a certain way (Dweck, 2010, p. 29). As discussed in the implementing effective lessons section, I do my best to support the development of a growth mindset in my students. This is one of many reasons why I put time and effort into that development.

                &emsp;Another intervention that Yeager suggests is finding ways to help students feel like they belong. When students do not feel like they belong they become increasingly stressed and can slowly lose their motivation and engagement (Yeager, 2013, p. 62). One way that I tried to help foster a sense of belonging in all of my students was to have small groups hold discussions about prominent scientists with non-traditional backgrounds. Scientists that they were charged with discussing including Grace Hopper and Alan Turing. I asked them to consider in their discussion how who these scientists were as people affected the work that they did. This sparked some conversations about what it is like to be a woman working in a predominantly male field, among other things. My motivation for holding these discussions was both to show students who are minorities that they can absolutely be successful scientists but also to help students who are not in those groups gain some sort of awareness of what people in those groups experience. This assignment can be found in Appendix.

                &emsp;A sense of belonging is essential for feeling safe and confident as a learner. I always make an effort to support my students whenever they express doubts and to remind them that even the “best” students in the class had to start learning from nothing at some point. I have also tried to help my students feel that they belong by talking about my own experiences as a person from a traditionally marginalized background who has a career in a STEM field. Although my experiences are definitely different from theirs, I want them to know that just because you do not fit the stereotype, that does not mean that you cannot do what you want to do. I also work to hold high standards and provide critical feedback for every student in my classroom. This has been shown to foster a sense of trust between teachers and traditionally marginalized students who might worry that their teachers are biased against them because of their backgrounds (Yeager, 2013, p.63).

                &emsp;It is difficult enough to feel like you do not belong. Students can develop this feeling because of a stereotype against their race or gender or simply because they are not sure that they are “smart” enough for the class for some reason. It is important to me that every student feels that they are capable and that they can trust me to help them learn, regardless of who they are. In my class, I stress the fact that everyone has different skills and that everyone has places to grow. Students who come in with strong work ethic and zero background knowledge have just as much of a right to learn as students who come in with extensive experience and knowledge. Ultimately, I feel that all of the interventions that I bring into my classroom to account for difference come back to encouraging my students to develop a growth mindset and the idea that all of my students are fully capable of accomplishing anything that they put their mind to.

                &emsp;In the future, I want to work even harder to acknowledge and respond to my students’ differences. As I have mentioned before, responsive teaching is important to me and I want to respond to my students’ needs. This applies just as much to my students’ cultural differences as it does to gaps in their physics knowledge.
