                &emsp;Experiential learning is a term that has been used to describe many different teaching methods, and not without cause. Depending on how you define experiential learning, just about anything could fall into the category. Reflective learning suffers from a similar dilemma. Neither experiential learning nor reflective learning have hard and fast definitions. There are as many definitions of these two terms as there are academic papers on the subjects. Author Jennifer Moon provides different definitions of experiential learning from no less than fifteen academic papers in an attempt to showcase just how many opinions there are on the subject. This variety is obviously somewhat overwhelming and Moon goes on to note that, “Seeking unanimity from this range of view is not possible” and that not every view from the field of experiential learning has even been represented in the large selection of views that she has shared (2004, p. 108-111).</p>
                <p>
                &emsp;Given the complex state of the field of experiential learning, examples of methods that are considered experiential learning are a good way to begin to understand the field. Many of the most commonly used experiential learning techniques are sequential approaches. They describe a series of steps that are meant to ultimately lead to experiential learning. A well-known example of an experiential learning sequence is the Kolb cycle. In this cycle, the learner travels from concrete experience to observation and reflection to abstract conceptualization to active experimentation and back around to concrete experience (Moon, 2004, p. 126). Many other experiential learning sequences are based on the Kolb cycle, often reordering, adding to, and clarifying the different phases of the cycle (Moon, 2004, p. 114-116). Another example of an experiential learning sequence is the 5E model of engage, explore, explain, elaborate, and evaluate which has been expanded into the 7E model of elicit, engage, explore, explain, elaborate, evaluate, and extend. The 7E model as described by Eisenkraft includes examples of the kind of exercises that a teacher could do for each step of the model along with academic support explaining the purpose of each step in the sequence (2003, p. 57). Wiggins and McTighe suggest an even more explicit 12-step process for experiential learning that includes assessment suggestions (2008, p. 38-41).</p>
                <p>
                &emsp;Sequential approaches to experiential learning are attractive because they provide an access point for instructors who are new to teaching in an experiential learning classroom. Reading like recipes, they often include sample activities and act as a guide for how an instructor can manage experiential learners. Some criticize such approaches for being too simplistic but it is likely that experiential learning is as well-known as it is today because approaches like these are easy to popularize (Moon, 2004, p. 114-116). They are not, however, the only approaches to experiential learning.</p>
                <p>
                &emsp;Inquiry-based learning, as described by Heather Banchi, is an example of an experiential learning method that is similar to the sequential approaches described above except that is applied on a much larger scale time scale and focuses on gaining the skills to do experiential learning well. Inquiry-based learning has four levels: confirmation, structured, guided, and open. Rather than progressing through each of these levels of inquiry in a single project, however, students might progress through these levels over the course of an entire year or even multiple years. This method seems optimized for lab-based science classrooms. Confirmation inquiry is the simplest form of inquiry where students answer a question that they already known the answer to using a procedure that they are given. Students make their way up the levels of inquiry over time, losing access to the answer to the question that they are given (structured inquiry), beginning to develop their own procedures (guided inquiry), and eventually even coming up with their own questions (open inquiry) (Banchi, 2008, p. 29-30). This is an interesting method because it acknowledges that students generally need support as they build their experiential learning skills and because rather than focusing on how to teach a single concept or unit, it describes the process of learning the skills necessary to do experiential learning at a high level over an extended period time.</p> 
                <p>
                &emsp;An example of a more general experiential learning method is problem-based learning (PBL). PBL is another term that is not clearly defined. Generally, however, PBL is based on an ill-structured problem that is authentic to the “real world”, has a student-centered approach, and uses teachers as facilitators whose role lessens throughout the process (Strobel, 2009, p. 45-46). Students usually work in small groups and are not necessarily given all of the information that they will need to solve the problem (Gordon, 2001, p. 171). This type of experiential learning is much less well defined than sequenced experiential learning. The line between what is and is not PBL is not entirely clear and even classes that are designed to fit into the criteria described above can look very different from one another.</p>
                <p>
                &emsp;As the examples above show, the variety of teaching methods that can be considered experiential learning is astounding. Rather than trying to unify the many definitions and styles of experiential learning, Moon attempts to create a list of connotations that encapsulate the boundaries of what are commonly considered experiential learning practices. She strives to define the edges of what is considered experiential learning rather than trying to fill in the center. She writes that the common features of an experiential learning curriculum are learners who are responsible for directing their own learning, direct experience of curriculum, reflection, an “active” phase, feedback, an intention to learn, and the general feeling that it is a good way to learn (Moon, 2004, p. 74, 122). This list of features is very descriptive, aware of the complexity of the field, and in agreement with the examples listed above.</p> 
                <p>
                &emsp;A similar but more traditional definition was developed by McGill and Warner Weil who write that experiential learning is, “The process whereby people individually and in association with others, engage in direct encounter, then purposefully reflect upon, validate, transform, give personal meaning to and seek to integrate their different ways of knowing” (as cited in Moon, 1989, p. 248). Although they do not share the exact same perspective as Moon, McGill and Warner Weil’s definition is somewhat easier to engage with than the bulleted list that Moon offers and it agrees with her list of connotations on most of its points. Among the many definitions of what experiential learning is the important idea that an experience in and of itself is not enough to be considered experiential learning. This idea is central to this inquiry project.</p>
                <p>
                &emsp;Experience is not the same thing as experiential learning. Robert Gremore writes that many people can share the exact same experience and take away entirely different lessons from it (1985, p. 17). This is an important consideration for experiential learning because it suggests that a shared experience does not necessarily indicate shared learning. Moon posits that the reason for the discrepancy in learning between individuals in the same situation is because experience is a construct. She suggests that an experience has no meaning on its own, that it is the person who is living the experience who interprets the situation based on their unique viewpoint (Moon, 2004, p. 107). This is why one person can find a class earth-shatteringly profound while another person can fall asleep in the same room at the same time.</p> 
                <p>
                &emsp;When experiential learning is used as a teaching strategy, however, there is usually some sort of intended learning goal for students. Although there might be infinitely many constructions of a single experience, a teacher is trying to direct her students towards a particular type of experience. For this reason, experiential learners must be guided in the direction of the knowledge that they are supposed to be learning. Gremore remarks that if there is no guidance, students can come to the wrong conclusions or, worse, “that their experiential learning will remain inarticulate, below the level of consciousness, fragmented, unintegrated with other knowledge, and unavailable for critical inspection and development” (1985, p. 20). Without guidance, something that was supposed to be experiential learning may remain only an experience. This is because an “experience must be processed in order that knowledge can result from it” (Moon, 2004, p. 113).</p>
                <p>
                &emsp;Student directed learning, however, is a defining characteristic of experiential learning. Taking direct control of student learning as an instructor would mean disqualify a teaching method from being considered experiential learning. In order for experience to become experiential learning, there must be a way for students to process their experiences and a way for instructors to follow along with the mental processes of their students to make sure that they are moving in the right direction while still allowing students to direct their own learning. Reflective learning and the creation of an artifact that is representative of that reflective learning is one way to accomplish these goals. In fact, reflective practice is included in many, but not all, definitions of experiential learning in some way whether it is written explicitly or merely hinted at (Moon, 2004, p. 108-109).</p> 
                <p>
                &emsp;There are many different ways to define reflection, however, what many of the definitions of reflection have in common is an emphasis on “purposeful critical analysis of knowledge and experience so as to achieve a deeper meaning and understanding” (Lew, 2011, p. 530). Reflection examines existing knowledge and experiences and attempts to reorganize what is already known in order to incorporate new knowledge or experiences. Most research focuses less on how reflection actually works and more on its outcomes, however (Moon, 2004, p. 83). Hmelo-Silver describes the many benefits of reflection, writing that, “Reflection helps students (a) relate their new knowledge to their prior understanding, (b) mindfully abstract knowledge, and (c) understand how their learning and problem-solving strategies might be reapplied” and suggests that reflection should also increase the possibility of transfer of knowledge between experiences (2004, p. 247). With all of these possible positive outcomes, it is important to understand the mechanics of reflection so that reflective curriculum can be developed to help students achieve these outcomes.</p>
                <p>
                &emsp;Relating new knowledge to prior understandings, point (a) of Hmelo-Silver’s list of benefits of reflection, is a goal of many learning practices but it also represents one of the challenges of reflection (2004, p. 247). Reflective learning is an experience and as such, it is constructed by the individual. This means that it has some of the same challenges as experiential learning does. For example, reflection has the most impact when the ideas or experiences being reflected upon are complex or difficult to understand. However, each individual learner might rank the complexity of the same experience differently because they have different prior knowledge and experiences (Moon, 2004, p. 87). Similarly, it is not really possible to say that an assignment is reflective because it is not possible to judge how reflective a particular activity is for an individual. It is only really possible to say that an activity is designed to inspire reflection (Moon, 2004, p. 92). This is further complicated by the fact that students might attempt to create reflections that will be seen as “good” by their instructors rather than actually reflecting if they know that an instructor will be reading their reflections (Moon, 2004, p. 83). Therefore, it is very important to use reflective assignments as learning tools rather than graded assessments in order to encourage students to generate more honest records of their experiences (Gremore, 1985, 21). Due to these challenges, student intent during reflection and prior knowledge are incredibly important to developing successful reflective learning in the classroom.</p>
                <p>
                &emsp;One of the most common ways to encourage reflection in the classroom is through the use of learning journals. A major benefit of this method of reflection for instructors is that they can read along and attempt to understand where each student is in their learning. However, asking students to represent their learning in any medium, in writing, orally, etc., can help them reach a deeper understanding of the ideas that they are reflecting upon because in order to represent the ideas they have to change them (Moon, 2004, p. 85). It is this process that helps fulfill point (b) of Hmelo-Silver’s purposes of reflection, helping students mindfully abstract knowledge (2004, p. 247). Creating a representation of learning such as a reflective journal often requires mindful abstraction, particularly when reflection is deeper. In this process, students abstract what they have learned to try to generate a more general understanding of how the world works. For example, a mathematical formula could be abstracted from an example problem by a reflective math student. Students who gain knowledge in this way, rather than passively receiving it from an instructor, are generally able to transfer their knowledge further (Salomon, 1989, p. 125-126). Finally, once students have successfully created a representation of their learning, they can evaluate the representation of their learning and learn from that as well (Moon, 2004, p. 91). It is worth noting that new material does not need to be learned in order for this process to happen. Students can use this process to reorganize what they already know in a process known as “cognitive housekeeping” (Moon, 2004, p. 90).</p>
                <p>
                &emsp;Understanding how to apply learning strategies, point (c) of Hmelo-Silver’s list of benefits of reflection, points squarely to the impact that reflection can have on cognitive and metacognitive practices (2004, p. 247). A cognitive strategy provides knowledge for how to complete a task while metacognitive strategy helps a learner choose which cognitive strategy is most applicable to a situation and then helps them use that strategy. In order to successfully problem solve and learn, students need to have a variety of cognitive strategies to choose from and then they need to use metacognitive strategies that will help them choose the right cognitive strategy for the situation. Both types of strategies are necessary because it is possible to know a cognitive strategy but not know when or how to use it, making it essentially useless. The development of these strategies is known as cognitive awareness and it is critical for effective learning. Research suggests that reflective exercises such as learning journals can increase metacognition by making students aware of their cognitive processes and helping them learn to manage those processes (McCrindle, 1995, 169-172).</p>
                <p>
                &emsp;The results of academic research on reflection generally agree that reflective practices are beneficial. Studies have found that students who reflect develop better learning skills as well as doing better on traditional measures of learning such as final exams (McCrindle, 1995; Lew 2011).  In addition to the benefits listed by Hmelo-Silver, reflection also has the added benefits of helping students develop a connection between their emotions and the academic material that they have learned leading to a more holistic form of education (Moon, 2004, p. 100).</p>
                <p>
                &emsp;It is easy to see why experiential learning and reflection go hand-in-hand. A more holistic education is also one of the selling points of experiential learning. One of the major goals of experiential learning is to help students gain the practical learning skills that they will need to be successful later in life. If reflection is used in an experiential learning class, much of the “learning how to learn” may actually be a result from the cognitive and metacognitive effects of reflection. Intent and a sense of purpose are important for both experiential and reflective learning. It would be easy to go through a lab or write a few sentences about your day without learning anything. It is only when students intend to learn that they gain the benefits of these two types of learning. Both types of learning are also heavily dependent on the past experiences and prior knowledge of the students in the class.</p>
                <p>
                &emsp;When experiential learning is used effectively and includes reflective phases, it can be very effective. Students who are taught using experiential learning techniques retain knowledge long-term, develop skills including lifelong learning skills, establish understandings that are flexible, are satisfied with their experiences, improve their behavior, and exhibit better academic performance (Hmelo-Silver, 2004; Strobel 2009; Gordon, 2001). Although there are definitely challenges associated with working in an experiential learning classroom and using reflection as a learning tool, the many benefits far outweigh them.
