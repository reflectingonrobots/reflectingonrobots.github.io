                <h1>Context</h1>
                <p>
                &emsp;The research described in this inquiry project was conducted at an elite New England boarding school. The school includes grades 9-12 as well as a small group of postgraduate students. The student body consists of just over 650 students from nearly 40 states and over 30 countries. The average class size is 12 students and students are generally very self-motivated and focused on their futures.
                This study was focused on a robotics elective course that students self-selected into. This course has been taught for many years and this is my second year teaching the course. Last year, I co-taught the course with my mentor teacher. This year I am teaching the course on my own and I have made a number of changes to the curriculum to better tailor the course to my own strengths. Robotics is a problems-based, experiential learning course that focuses on learning robotics skills through doing robotics projects. For all almost every project, students are asked to work in small groups of two or three. The curriculum is designed to teach students a combination of electrical and mechanical engineering skills, including programming, as well as project management and group work skills.</p>
                <p>
                &emsp;There are nine students enrolled in the robotics course this year. Robotics is generally reserved for junior, senior, and postgraduate students but this year a sophomore was allowed to enroll in the course with instructor permission. The grade level breakdown for the members of this class is: one postgraduate, four seniors, three juniors, and one sophomore. There are three girls and six boys in the class. About half of the class came in with some programming or robotics experience while the other half had little to no experience. This group is very diverse in terms of their maturity and experience levels which proved to be an added challenge when teaching the course.</p>
                <p>
                &emsp;The robotics classroom is a dedicated classroom that is only used for the robotics class. It is a very small room at the end of a hall with floor to ceiling windows along one wall. There is shelving that covers all three of the other walls in the room. This shelving stores the many, many supplies used in this course including a small 3d printer. Each student has their own cabinet in which they keep their projects and personal supplies. In the center of the room there are three large lab tables that are pushed together to form one table that extends most of the length of the room. Students generally sit on high wooden lab stools but will sometimes bring in high chairs from another classroom because the room does not actually have enough chairs in it for all of the students in the class. Some students will sometimes opt to work in either the robotics club room or in a physics classroom that is empty during the period in order to spread out a bit and have a quieter space to work in. Both of these rooms are just down the hall from the robotics classroom. If a lesson requires a large whiteboard or a projector the class meets in the empty physics classroom since the robotics classroom does not have either of those tools available. There have also been times where the class has met in the workshop/makerspace in the library in order to use the larger 3d printer that is located there or to have a larger space to work in. The majority of the time, however, the class meets in the robotics room.</p>
                <h1>Data Collection Methods</h1>
	            <p>
                &emsp;The guiding question for this inquiry project is, “How can intentional reflection be used in conjunction with experiential learning to improve student learning outcomes?” I collected a number of different types of data in order to try to understand the interaction between experiential learning and reflection in my robotics classroom. The four main methods of data collection used in this project are: student journals, surveys, sociograms, and teacher notes.</p> 
	            <p>
                &emsp;Student journals are one of the most important data collection tools used in this study. Learning journals are a well-established method for helping students learn to reflect (Moon, 2004; Hmelo-Silver, 2004; Salomon, 1989). Students in my robotics class were given lab notebooks at the start of the year where they were expected to keep all of their notes for the class, including reflections. Students were asked to reflect on specific questions at least once every two weeks. More time was generally set aside for reflection during the time near the beginning and end of a project in an attempt to help students reflect on how their learning in the previous project might be applied to the next project. Some students preferred to type their reflections rather than write them out by hand. These students were responsible for emailing me their reflections at the end of every reflection session. Student notebooks were collected periodically and all reflections were recorded before handing them back.</p>
	            <p>
                &emsp;Surveys, in the form of peer assessments, also became a centrally important data collection tool. I asked students to complete peer assessments for every member of every group that they worked with. For one longer project, I also asked students to complete a mid-project peer assessment. About halfway through the year I began asking students to complete a peer evaluation for themselves as well as for their peers. The goal of this was to help students reflect on their own role in the dynamics of their group. I used these surveys as a “snapshot of a moment in time” as Hubbard and Power suggest (2003, p. 65). They capture a moment in a student’s development as seen through their own eyes or the eyes of a peer. The same questions were used in the surveys throughout the whole year and it was provided to students as a Google form. Students usually filled out the survey for homework. The questionnaire can be seen in its entirety in Appendix A.</p>
	            <p>
                &emsp;Sociograms were created from the final two questions of the survey. Sociograms are a useful research tool because they chart relationships within a class and can give an idea of the social and power structures between students (Hubbard, 2003, p. 73). Since robotics is a class that is almost entirely based in group work, these are important understandings to have. In addition, changes in the sociogram over time might be able to help show changes in a student’s social development. </p>
                <p>
                &emsp;The final method of data collection used was teacher note taking. Notes are one of the most common methods of data collection and they are incredibly useful as a teacher researcher.  Although there are many methods of note taking, I chose to spend some time after students left class recording the events of the day as Hubbard and Power suggest (2003, p. 53). My notes became a combination of field notes and theoretical notes (Hubbard, 2003, p. 46). I often found myself writing down a scenario that occurred as a field note, trying to describe the situation fully and objectively. Then, I would follow that description with a theoretical note, a sentence or two that attempted to understand the significance of what had happened in the situation. This method of taking notes was useful because it allowed me to continue to examine the field notes in light of new information throughout the year and gave me the room to make new interpretations but it also kept me from losing sight of the perspective that I had at the time of the original note taking. These notes, which contained my point of view, were an important addition to the surveys which contained student points of view.</p>

                <h1>Data Analysis Methods</h1>
	            <p>
                &emsp;Once data was collected, several different methods were used to analyze it. I began my analysis by annotating my notes, the student learning journals, and the evaluations by topic. I then created an index of the different topics that I had noted in my data. I used the indexing process as a way to further clarify and explore what topics were really represented in my data (Hubbard, 2003, p. 92-104). I also developed a sociogram based on student answers to survey questions (Hubbard, 2003, p. 73-78).</p>
                <p>
                &emsp;I then utilized the structure of learning outcomes (SOLO) taxonomy to attempt to assess the depth of my students’ reflection in both their evaluations and their reflective journals. I chose to use the Biggs and Collis’ SOLO taxonomy since its levels are closely related to stages of deepening reflection (Moon, 2004, p. 85). The SOLO taxonomy is based on the Piagetian stages of development but in contrast to Piaget, whose stages of development are used to label an individual’s capabilities, Biggs’ levels of learning outcomes label a student’s response to a particular situation. There are five different levels in the SOLO taxonomy and each level is characterized by the working memory required, how concepts are related to one another, and the need for consistency and closure.</p> 
                <p>
                &emsp;The lowest level of the SOLO taxonomy is prestructural. This level is characterized by a response where the student is unable to hold the question and the response in their mind at the same time, generating a confusing answer that uses irrelevant data without seeing the need to come up with a better answer. The next level up is unistructural. In this level, a student is able to hold both the question and one piece of relevant data in their mind at once but they come to a conclusion based on one piece of data and do not see the need to seek a more consistent answer. The third level is multistructural, where a student responds with several pieces of relevant data and is able to relate them to one an answer. They have some sense of consistency in their answer but the relationships between the pieces of data that they used are not considered which can cause inconsistent answers. Relational is the fourth level of the taxonomy. At this level, a student response relates multiple pieces of relevant data to their response and is aware of the relationships between the pieces data that they are using. However, this answer is not generalizable and relies only on what the student already knows or has experienced. The highest level of the taxonomy is extended abstract. At this level, the student response uses multiple pieces of related data as well as hypotheses and abstractions of what they already know. All of these pieces are related to their answer and understood in light of each other. In addition to these five stages, it is also possible to have transitional stages, which are noted with an A. For example, 1A is the transitional state between the prestructural and unistructural levels. (Biggs, 1982, 24-29).</p> 
                <p>
                &emsp;Rather than using the original taxonomy, however, I chose to base my SOLO assessments on a modified version of the taxonomy. One issue with the original SOLO taxonomy is that it can be somewhat ambiguous, leading to unreliable results. Chan created a modified version of the SOLO taxonomy that divided several of the SOLO levels into sub-categories, essentially expanding on the idea of transitional stages in the original taxonomy. Chan found that these changes to the taxonomy led to more reliable results (2002, p. 516). However, Chan’s research focused on evaluating longer, essay style writing while the student work that I was evaluating was much shorter in length, generally no more than a paragraph or two at most. Due to this difference in length I used Chan’s modifications to the taxonomy and descriptions of each level as a basis for my own.</p>
                <p>
                &emsp;After much consideration, I developed a system with seven different levels rather than the original taxonomy’s five levels or Chan’s modification of nine levels. I chose to keep Chan’s modification of breaking the multistructural level into three different levels - high, moderate, and low - but found that Chan’s similar breakdown of the relational level was not applicable to the work that I was evaluating due to the shorter length of the responses that I was evaluating. In addition, I made some changes to the descriptions of each level that Chan developed, particularly for the multistructural levels. The most significant change that I made was to explicitly state that I would consider one relevant piece of data with several points of elaboration a moderately multistructural response rather than a unistructural response. I felt that multiple points of support were sufficient for considering a response multistructural. I also lowered the number of points necessary for a response to be considered multistructural due to the shorter length expected of my students’ responses. Every level was also given a corresponding numerical coding in order to facilitate the analysis of and find meaningful trends in the large amount of data that resulted from applying the taxonomy. The full list of levels, descriptions, and codings can be found in Appendix B.</p>
                <p>
                &emsp;After determining the specific criteria for each level of the modified SOLO taxonomy I began evaluating student responses. I evaluated every student reflection and each question of every peer and self evaluation. Once finished evaluating, I began to examine the trends in my evaluations. Specifically, I looked for changes in reflection depth over time, differences in reflection depth in evaluations versus in journal reflections, question types that produced different levels of reflections, differences in reflection depth in peer versus self evaluations, relationships between how easy a student found it to work with a peer and how deeply they reflected in their evaluation of that peer, and individual differences in reflection depth.</p> 
                <p>
                &emsp;Finally, I used triangulation to consider the interaction between the topics that my students reflected on, the depth of reflection as judged using the SOLO taxonomy, and the internal social relationships my classroom based on the sociogram (Hubbard, 2003, 124-127).</p>
                <h1>Data Analysis Results</h1>
                <h1>Topic Analysis</h1>
                <p>
                &emsp;Topic analysis revealed specific trends in my students’ reflections. I began the categorization process by writing down some likely topics based on my previous readings of student reflections and then I expanded my list of categories based on what I found as I went through analyzing the data. I only stopped modifying and added to the list of categories when I felt that everything that was written in the reflections fell into a category. Through this process, I found that students most often mentioned, in no particular order, collaboration, software, hardware, mistakes, design, project management, mindset, other growth, and other learning methods. The most frequently mentioned categories in the peer evaluations were project management and collaboration. Journal reflections tended to have much more mixed responses but seemed to focus mostly on collaboration, software, hardware, mistakes, design, and project management.</p>
                <p>
                &emsp;Collaboration is a very important topic in my robotics class so it makes sense that it is front and center in the reflective responses. Particularly in the peer evaluations, it seems reasonable that students would discuss how they work with their peers. I also asked specific questions about collaboration for the journal reflections which likely resulted in higher amounts of reflection on collaboration in that data set.</p> 
                <p>
                &emsp;Software and hardware, representative of the technical skills learned in the class, were mentioned far less than might be expected in such a technically intensive course. I suspect that this might be because I treat software and hardware as skills that come with time as students do projects while I actively work to help students collaborate better, design better, and learn more from their mistakes. I have made the conscious decision to teach in this way because I feel that my students have less experience learning non-technical skills and that the non-technical skills will really be what they take away from the class. This approach could be impacting how much my students reflect on their technical skills even when the questions are open ended and are designed allow them the space to reflect on anything.</p> 
                <p>
                &emsp;Throughout the categorization process, I found that mistakes became a sort of sub-coding. Comments that were marked as mistakes were often also marked with project management, hardware, software, or collaboration since the mistake was usually rooted in another category. I was surprised to find less mentions of mistakes than I expected since failure and mistakes are a huge topic of conversation in my class.</p>
                <p>
                &emsp;Design is a category that got a significant bump in mentions at the point in the curriculum where we began to discuss how to design better. This is partially due to the fact that several journal reflection questions asked specifically about design. However, there are also many shorter references that students made to design, possibly unintentionally, while reflecting on their experiences.</p>
                <p>
                &emsp;Project management was one of the most commonly mentioned categories in both peer review and journal reflections. I suspect that this is due to how challenging this class is in terms of project management skills. Students are given long term projects and, with some support, expected to learn to manage both their time and their team in order to finish the projects. It seems that this level of project management is new to many students in the class and they tend to struggle with it, making it a very reasonable topic to consider when reflecting back on a project. Project management also seems like a particularly relevant topic to discuss when completing a peer evaluation.</p>
                <p>
                &emsp;Mindset, other growth, and other learning methods were categories that were added comparatively later on in the coding process in order to more accurately cover the breadth of topics discussed by students in their reflections. Mindset referred to any references about how the student felt, other growth was used to tag types of growth that did not fit into the other categories, and other learning methods was used to tag methods of learning methods that were not covered in the other categories. Although they were not found in the data as frequently as the other categories, these categories are still important to note in order to complete the view of the data set.</p>
                <p>
                &emsp;Beyond the class level view, evaluating the categories used in these reflective exercises also highlighted individual differences in the class. The peer evaluations in particular suggest areas where several students shine. For example, there are several students whose evaluations bring up design skills much more often than other students’. These students are several of the students in the class who are the strongest in design. This trend suggests that the students in my class are really paying attention to each other and that they are able to notice the strengths and weaknesses of their peers.</p>
                <h1>Reflection Depth</h1>
	            <p>
                &emsp;Although there were many opportunities for reflection, analysis using the SOLO taxonomy does not suggest that students deepened their reflections over time. Instead, over time students seemed to converge to moderately multistructural journal reflections, right near the middle of the scale. Peer evaluations tended to be lower on the SOLO scale, converging just under multistructural low. Upon seeing these results I considered the structure that I had developed around reflection in my class and realized that I had not really provided any instruction on how to reflect more deeply or very much feedback on the reflections that I did receive. This suggests that since I did not ask my students to deepen their reflections or help them learn to do it, they simply did not deepen their reflections.</p>
                <p>
                &emsp;Although there were no real trends in the journal reflections’ SOLO ratings over time, there was some pattern to the SOLO ratings for peer evaluations over time. Ratings were somewhat higher for the first project and for the two peer evaluations conducted during the longest project. The ratings for these three projects were closer to multistructural low while the ratings for the other two were closer to unistructural, on average. It seems reasonable that the first peer evaluation was more reflective since it was their first time completing one for the class and it does not seem surprising that students were more reflective when evaluating their team during the longest and most challenging project of the course. A sample size of five peer evaluations is not a very strong basis for this claim, however.</p>
                <p>
                &emsp;While students always seemed to be at least somewhat reflective in their responses regardless of the question used to prompt reflection, some questions seemed to help them reach deeper states of reflection more easily. The question, “What do you think of all of the reflections that we have been doing?” was by far the question that produced the deepest levels of reflection according to the SOLO ratings, with an average rating of multistructural high. In contrast, there were several other questions concerning the nature of learning and how students were learning that produced the lowest SOLO ratings, with an average ranking on the high end of multistructural low. This suggests that questions that are more accessible to students, ones that have a direct connection to what they have been doing, might make it easier for students to reflect deeply. The questions about learning methods, which had the lowest scores, were ones that I had difficulty articulating to students while the question about reflection, which had the highest scores, had a clear and direct relationship to what they did every day in class.</p>
                <p>
                &emsp;The questions on the peer evaluations also seemed to impact the depth of student reflections. The peer evaluations included four questions that had a space to write a longer answer. Two of the questions concerned what the student being evaluated did well while the two other questions concerned what the student being evaluated could do better. I included two questions for each category in hopes that a slightly different question might trigger different memories and create a more complete evaluation. However, the SOLO ratings show that the first time a question for each category is asked, student responses are multistructural low and the second time, student responses are beginning to fade toward unistructural. This suggests that although there might be some new information being generated by asking the second question in each category, students do seem to become less reflective in their answers when a similar question is asked multiple times.</p>
                <p>
                &emsp;Since students completed peer evaluations for both themselves and for their teams, it provided an opportunity to compare how their reflection changed when the questions were the same but the person being evaluated was different. Analysis of the data suggests that many students were more reflective in their evaluations of themselves than in their evaluations of others. Although this difference was not large, it was noticeable. This trend could possibly be due to the fact that the students had more practice reflecting on themselves in the journal reflections or because of something as mundane as being more focused on themselves and thus better able to reflect on their own behavior.</p>
                <p>
                &emsp;The data showed no relationship between how easy a student felt it was to work with a peer and how deeply the reflected on their evaluation of that peer. I suspected that students might have lower SOLO scores for peers who they felt that they were very compatible with or very incompatible with and was pleasantly surprised to see that the data did not support that hypothesis. This suggests that students were fairly equal in the depth of their reflection regardless of who they were evaluating.</p>
                <p>
                &emsp;Finally, it is noteworthy that some students were consistently more reflective than others in their peer evaluations. On average, the highest SOLO rated student’s peer evaluations were nearing multistructural moderate while the lowest was solidly unistructural. The difference in SOLO rating was not as sharp in the journal reflections but it was present. This suggests that generalizations about the class as a whole may be somewhat inaccurate due to individual differences.</p>
                <h1>Social Relationships</h1>
	            <p>
                &emsp;Social relationships are very important in my robotics class since most projects are done in groups. The classroom environment that I have setup requires extensive collaboration and social skills from my students. The development of a sociogram showed that there are two “stars” who everyone enjoyed working with and that most people had two to three mutual choices. There was, however, one isolate. Upon further analysis of the peer evaluations it became apparent that there was a stark contrast in how the isolate felt he was doing in the class and how his peers felt that he was doing in this class. This discrepancy was likely the cause of this students’ isolation. Since he likely did not understand what he was doing wrong in the groups that he was working in, he was not able to make changes to improve his collaboration skills.</p>
                <h1>Make graphic.</h1>
                <h1>Discussion and Conclusions</h1>
	            <p>
                &emsp;Overall, I have found that using reflection as a tool in my experiential learning classroom has been a very positive experience for both myself and my students. The data that I have collected throughout this process suggest that my students are thinking about the topics that are at the center of the course’s curriculum and that it is likely that they are reflecting at a reasonably deep level when I ask them to reflect. It has also directed me towards including curriculum on how to help my students reflect more deeply, made me aware of how to craft questions that might encourage my students reflect more deeply, and allowed me to get to know how my students are seen by their peers as well as how they see themselves. I was encouraged to find data suggesting that my students reflected at roughly the same depth regardless of which of their peers they were evaluating and I was unsurprised to find that the students in my class are all very different and that they all reflect at different levels. It was not possible to assess a relationship between reflection and learning in this experimental setup but the fact that it appears that my students are reflecting and that they are likely reflecting on the things that I hoped that they would reflect on is certainly a step in the right direction.</p>
	            <p>
                &emsp;Although there have been many positive outcomes from this research, it is far from perfect. The small number of students surveyed makes it difficult to draw conclusions, especially since there were a number of missing data points from times when students missed class or did not complete an assignment for some reason. There were other issues in the methods used, such as the fact that class time was provided for the journal reflections while peer evaluations were given as homework. This difference could have impacted the amount of time that students spent reflecting on their responses and thus the SOLO scores derived from those responses. At least one student felt that it was difficult to reflect deeply in her journal because she knew that it was going to be read and others may have felt the same. Students who have a lack of desire to have their deep reflections read by someone else could severely impact the data collected for this research.</p>
	            <p>
                &emsp;The SOLO taxonomy was a useful tool but I also found it somewhat limiting. Generally, I felt that I agreed with the ratings that each reflection received based on the criteria found in Appendix B but despite using the modified version of the taxonomy there were often responses that I found difficult to categorize. In addition, I often found myself wondering about what was happening in my students’ heads while they wrote these reflections. Some students wrote shorthand notes that were rated low on the SOLO scale but the notes suggested that deeper reflection might be going on in their heads. However, since there is not really a way to gain access to what my students are thinking, I found that the SOLO taxonomy was a good way to meaningfully categorize my students’ reflections.</p>
	            <p>
                &emsp;In addition to all of the conclusions that the data I collected supports, there were many other less analytical benefits. The most important of these benefits was that I truly got to know my students better as people. The reflections allowed me to have a brief look inside of their heads so that I knew who needed encouragement and who needed to be told that the way that they are relating to other people is not working. It also allowed me to have specific points and a written record to go back to when writing course comments at the end of each term. </p>

                &emsp;Most importantly, however, my students liked the reflections and felt that they were useful. I did not have a single student who said that they did not like them or that they did not want to do them any more. Instead, they said that they helped them to get their thoughts on the page and that it provided a record of their learning that they could look back and appreciate. I love what reflection has done in my experiential learning classroom and I definitely plan to continue to use it in the future.
