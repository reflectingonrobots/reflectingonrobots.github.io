                    <p>Learning by doing is one of the cornerstones of my classroom. My students tend to walk into my classroom with a lot of theory but not very much practice. I use experiential learning as a way to help my students connect what they know with what they do and, ultimately, I hope that it helps them learn more deeply.</p>

                    <p>Reflection is a technique that is often associated with disciplines that are writing based, such as English, but it can be used as an effective tool in any discipline. I used refelction in my classroom to encourage my students to evaluate their own learning and experiences on a deeper level.</p>
