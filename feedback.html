                &emsp;A test should be a learning tool (Brown, 2014, p. 19). This idea was a revelation for me, not because it did not make sense when I heard it but because a test was not something that I thought of as a method for gaining deeper insight into my own learning. In my own education, tests felt like an end. In my classroom, I want assessments of any kind to feel like a beginning. I want to help my students use assessments as a way to see their current development and chart a path to even more success in the future. I learned that this way of using assessments, as “a way to make students’ thinking visible to both teachers and students,” is known as a formative assessment (Bransford, 2004, p. 24). Formative assessments are different from traditional summative assessments, like a final exam, because they are given along the way and intended to help students and teachers see where they are at and what they can do to improve while they are still in a position to make meaningful changes. Formative assessments are particularly important in a responsive classroom because if the teacher does not know what students know, think, and feel, then she cannot adjust her curriculum accordingly.

                <p>
                &emsp;A formative assessment is not complete, however, without feedback. In order for students to find ways to improve, they have to get some sort of feedback. Wiggins defines feedback as “information about how we are doing in our efforts to reach a goal” (2012, p. 10). Since formative assessments center on making thinking visible so that it can be improved, feedback is a natural partner. Wiggins writes that there are seven keys to feedback: effective feedback should be focused on goals, have tangible results, include action items, be specific and personalized, be timely, ongoing, and consistent (2012, p. 11-14).

                &emsp;Providing feedback that is effective is a practice that I put a lot of energy into in my second year of teaching. Every one of my robotics and web design students has a document where I write feedback for them on every project that they turn in. My students have access to pages and pages of feedback on both their technical skills and their “soft” skills such as collaboration and attitude that is undoubtedly specific and personalized since I write each one individually. I also make it a point not give my students their numerical scores, I only give them the feedback document. I do this because I want the goal to be skills, not grades. If students want to know their scores, they must go through and make substantial comments throughout their entire feedback document. I have yet to have a student ask me for their grades who was serious enough to go through that process. Whenever a student asks what they can do better, I tell them to read through the document and let me know if they have any questions because the documents are designed to have explicit action items that they can follow if they would like to improve. 
                </p>
                <p>
                &emsp;I also have students complete peer and self-evaluations and I fold those into the feedback document, usually in the “soft” skills section. Peer and self-evaluations are valuable exercises because they help students begin to learn how to express the goals of an exercise and how to evaluate how successful either they or their peers are in reaching those goals (Black, 2003, p. 49-51). Although there are advantages to having students provide each other with feedback directly (Black, 2003, p. 49-51), by providing peer feedback to students through my own feedback I allow students to be open and honest in their feedback since they know that only I will be reading it. They also know that when I pass any criticism on it will not be linked to them explicitly. Since I am reading the peer evaluations and deciding what to share, I also do my best to make sure that students receive constructive criticism rather than the rant of a disgruntled teammate. An example of peer and self-evaluations can be found in Appendix.

                <p>
                &emsp;The feedback document is a living document that shows students their progress throughout the year where they can let me know if they disagree with something that I have written or ask questions simply by commenting. I am very proud of this system but I want to work on having more of a dialogue with students through the document. At the beginning of the year, I had students consistently commenting and asking questions but I put less emphasis on that as the year went on. I have also sometimes had difficulty with providing timely feedback when it is in written form. An of a student feedback document can be found in Appendix.
                </p>
                <p>
                &emsp;In addition to written feedback, however, I provide significant amounts of in-class, on the spot feedback to my students. Since my classes are based in experiential learning practices, I usually spend most of my classes going from student to student, checking in, and answering any questions that they might be having. This feedback consistently meets all seven of Wiggins’ keys to effective feedback and I am very happy with my implementation of this method of feedback.
                </p>
                <p>
                &emsp;Feedback is not just for my students, however. I also frequently take time to ask my students how my teaching is working for them. Although I do my best to be responsive to my students’ needs as I see them, it is always helpful to have them tell me directly what they are struggling with in my class and how they think that I can help them learn better. I have received a lot of helpful feedback by just asking my students what has been working for them and what has not. I usually gather this information in online surveys that I send out to my students. This is a practice that I will definitely be continuing in the future.
